# RecipeCounter

Crawls a recipe tree and counts how much of what you need to craft.

## Limitations:
- Currently only supports recipes with single output
- Each item can only have one recipe that has it as output
- Items and Recipes are hardcoded in `src/Server/Recipes.fs` (for GregTech New Horizons 2.0.5.1)

While the plan was to work on this and fix the limitations, the advice I have gotten seems to have been true:
> Don't bother counting exact amounts, just craft more, you will need it later anyway
So consider this probably abandoned
